My tribute to Apple : A fully functional Mac-themed scientific calculator

## Why ?
Last Sunday, I was watching the movie "**Jobs**", the 2013 biographical movie on **Steve Jobs**, the man behind Apple. Not that I didn't expect that, but I was awestruck by the mind behind the glittery success the world sees.
**Ashton Kutcher** did a phenomenal work, as he stepped into the shoes of this eccentric genius.

Me, being an ardent Apple fan, thought of giving a sort of tribute to the wonderful dream facilitated by Steve and Woz.
Hence, iCalc.

## What is it ?
It is a a Mac-themed scientific calculator, designed to smoothly suit your needs. The user interface is pretty simple, and decent, with black and white shades soothing your conscience.
